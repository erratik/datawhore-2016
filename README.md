# datawhore-admin

Working on making erratik.ca a sweet as data aggregator again. Release 1 will have my admin and the content, probably looking fucking ugly.

Tracking all my social network data in one place, with node.js, express, angular and mongoose (hosted on mogolabs)

But then it will become an all-encompassing Tayana experience. :>
